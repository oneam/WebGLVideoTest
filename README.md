A study to figure out how to get video into a WebGL context and modify it using custom shaders.

I've purposely used only WebGL calls directly and attmpted to reduce the work to only what is required to get the scene to render. The intention is to use this as a basis for simplifying the YUV canvas used in h264bsd.
